# BatteryReminder
 Remember to unplug your Windows laptop when it's charged
### ⚠️ This software's GUI is only available in French for now.

## Presentation
 BatteryReminder shows a pop-up notification when it detects that your PC
 is charged at 100%. It can help you keep your battery alive for longer.
 For now, BatteryReminder only works on Windows 8.1, 10 and 11 operating
 systems, but I may make a version for macOS and Linux too later. It is
 a very simple program that contains 121 lines of C# code (excluding
 the metadata code files generated by Visual Studio).

## Installation (Windows)
 There isn't a built-in installer for BatteryReminder for Windows, so you
 have to install it yourself.
