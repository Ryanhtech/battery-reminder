# BatteryReminder
 Remember to unplug your Windows laptop when it's charged
### ⚠️ This software's GUI is only available in French for now.

## Presentation
 BatteryReminder shows a pop-up notification when it detects that your PC
 is charged at 100%. It can help you keep your battery alive for longer.
 For now, BatteryReminder only works on Windows 8.1, 10 and 11 operating
 systems, but I may make a version for macOS and Linux too later. It is
 a very simple program that contains 121 lines of C# code (excluding
 the metadata code files generated by Visual Studio).

## Installation (Windows)
 There isn't a built-in installer for BatteryReminder for Windows, so you
 have to install it yourself. **Only install it on a computer with a battery!**

### Step 1
 Download the release from [here](https://github.com/Ryanhtech/battery-reminder/releases/tag/release). Next, verify if .NET Framework 3.5 is installed on your computer, because it is required for BatteryReminder to run. It should be included with Windows 10/11, but to figure out, open the *BatteryReminder.exe* file and if you see a message box saying `Pour commencer à utiliser BatteryReminder, installez-le sur un appareil équipé d'une batterie.`, it means that .NET Framework works and you can continue to the next step.
